The four main access modifiers are:\n\n* **public:** Members declared as public are accessible from anywhere, from any class, even outside the package.\n* **private:** Members declared as private are only accessible from within the same class where they are declared. They are not accessible from subclasses or other classes.\n* **protected:** Members declared as protected are accessible within the same package and by subclasses (even if those subclasses are in a different package). They are not accessible by other classes outside the package that are not subclasses.\n* **default (package-private):** If no access modifier is specified, the member has package-private access. This means it's accessible from any class within the same package, but not from classes in other packages.\n\n**Differences:**\n\nThe key difference lies in the scope of accessibility:\n\n* **public** offers the widest access.\n* **private** offers the strictest access, limiting access to the declaring class only.\n* **protected** provides a middle ground, allowing access within the package and by subclasses.\n* **default/package-private** allows access within the package.",

It's defined in the Object class and needs to be overridden in custom classes to provide meaningful comparisons based on the class's attributes.  For String objects, '.equals()' compares the actual character sequences. \n\nTherefore, two different String objects with the same character sequence will be considered equal by '.equals()' but not by '=='.

Abstract classes are meant to be partially implemented blueprints.\n\n* **Interfaces:** Can only have abstract methods (since Java 8, they can also have default and static methods).  They cannot have instance variables (except static final constants). A class can implement multiple interfaces. Interfaces are purely abstract contracts specifying behaviour. \n\nIn short:  Abstract classes provide partial implementation, while interfaces provide complete abstraction.
